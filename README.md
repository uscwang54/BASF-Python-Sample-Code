Create a python function anagram_palyndrom_finder.py that can download and parse any
webpage to find words that are Anagrams / Palindromes in the page.

Create a BASH script that can take any web page URL as parameter, call the
anagram_palyndrom_finder.py with that URL and print the result to the terminal.
